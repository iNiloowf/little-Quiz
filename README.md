# little-Quiz

This code is a simple JavaScript program that prompts the user with a multiple-choice question and evaluates the answer given.

Functionality
The program uses a Map object to store the question, possible answers, correct answer, and feedback messages. The question and possible answers are displayed in the console using a for...of loop that iterates over the Map. The user is then prompted to enter an answer, and the program checks if the answer is correct by comparing it to the value stored under the Correct key in the Map.

If the answer is correct, the program displays a "Correct" message with a checkmark emoji. If the answer is incorrect, the program displays a "Try Again" message with a face with raised eyebrows emoji.
